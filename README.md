In this lab, I learned how to build a well-structured HTML5 webpage using semantic elements. I created a simple, clean layout with a header, navigation, main content, sidebar, and footer. I also implemented HTML5 form validation, ensuring fields like name, email, and message meet the required criteria before submission. The process taught me how to use the W3C Validator to catch and fix any HTML errors, and I got hands-on experience pushing my project to GitHub for version control and collaboration.
